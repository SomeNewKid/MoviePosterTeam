Create a single basic-style HTML document named index.html that lists the active
items returned by the get_active_items tool.

Use the get_active_items tool first. Treat its response as a JSON array of item
records. Build a friendly, self-contained page that summarizes the active items
and shows their id, item_key, title, status, notes, quantity, created_at, and
updated_at values. Use embedded CSS in a <style> block so the page is readable
and pleasant, but keep the design simple.

Before saving the document, call the add_company_header tool with the complete
HTML document you prepared. Treat the tool response as the finished HTML. Save
that finished HTML document with the save_html_document tool. After saving
index.html, save a short status message with the save_answer tool. The status
message should say which file was created and how many active items it lists.
